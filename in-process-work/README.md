- Description: This piece is one of my drafts. I tried to incorporate pixel sorting and text to get my data extraction idea across more effectively. 
This work is based on my Reasearch into digital inequality. Algorithms on the internet can effect certian groups disportionately and all of this is based on the data they collect. So I started reasearching data collection and that information gave me the ideas about data extraction.
